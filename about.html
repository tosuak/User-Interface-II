                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>My name is Tafiqul Tosuak. I am a 20 year old Bengali-American. I was born and raised in NYC but now I live in Virginia Beach. Some of my interests are soccer, boxing, making videos, and most importantly I  love technology. Ever since I was a toddler I've been always fascinated by computers and cameras. As I grew old and the tech world becomes bigger, I realized that I want to be apart of it. I was to learn how to create technology. How to read and write code. This is why I chose this path.</p>
